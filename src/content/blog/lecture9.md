For this lecture I asked one of my classmate to intercat with my prototype. We both observed and discussed the concept and interactions possible.

I was able to get feedback on the following aspects:

**Usability** : We found that the tool was exceptionally user-friendly, particularly with a screen that is larger than a watch but smaller than a smartphone. This design would make navigating the app and accessing real-time information remarkably straightforward.

**Motivation** : The glove-like design of the tool ensures accessibility at all times. This convenience eliminates the reluctance to use it, which can sometimes occur when retrieving a smartphone from a bag or pocket for additional information.

**Suggestions for Improvement** : While the prototype was promising, the glove size was a bit snug. To accommodate a wider range of users, it would be beneficial to offer different sizes and allow for the attachment of the same screen to various gloves. Furthermore, ensuring secure attachment is crucial, as one of the product's key advantages is the freedom to keep hands unencumbered.
