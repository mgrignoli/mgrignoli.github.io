Hi !

Last week in our Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) class, we delved deeper into the topic of augmenting human abilities in the era of augmented reality. For our upcoming assignments in lectures 7, 8, and 9, our task is to develop prototypes that embody this concept.

To begin I had to create, sketch and present at least 3 ideas.

##### I/ Glass translator

My first idea is very similar to google glass : an augmented reality language translation tool that allows users to see real-time translations of spoken or written text in a foreign language in the form of glasses.
It could use voice recognition and text analysis to provide translations through AR glasses or a smartphone app.
Travelers and international business professionals could use iy to bridge language barriers, making communication in foreign countries easier and more accessible.

##### II/ Fitness coach

The second idea  is a fitness coach that guides users through their workout routines. It tracks body movements and provides real-time feedback to ensure proper form and motivation.
It can display workout routines, count reps, monitor heart rate, and even simulate workout environments with sounds.
People looking to improve their fitness could use it to have a personalized and engaging fitness experience.

##### III/ Learning assistant glove

My last idea is an augmented reality glove designed to assist individuals in their learning journey. It can provide real-time information, explanations, and interactive demonstrations on various subjects.
It can recognize objects and scenes and offer relevant information. For instance, when a user points their AR device at a historical landmark, the glove could provide historical facts, videos, and even virtual tours.
Students and tourists could benefit from ARLA to enhance their understanding of subjects and places they encounter.
