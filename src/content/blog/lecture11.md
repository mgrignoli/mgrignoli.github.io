Hi again! In the 11th HCI lecture, we had to read the article <a href="https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Weiser-SciAm.pdf">"The Computer for the 21st Century"</a> by Mark Weiser, which delves into the idea of ubiquitous computing, where technology seamlessly integrates into our daily lives and becomes almost invisible. He draws a parallel between the evolution of writing, which has become ubiquitous in our society, and the current state of personal computers, which remain distinct from our environment.

Now, let's discuss my perspective on this concept of ubiquitous computing. I firmly believe that we are already living in a world of ubiquitous computing, and this transition has been a remarkable journey.


Weiser's notion of technology disappearing into the background aligns with the way we interact with devices today. Consider our smartphones; they've become extensions of ourselves, used for communication, information retrieval, navigation, and much more, all without us actively thinking about the underlying technology. Similarly, smart appliances in our homes and wearable devices like fitness trackers are seamlessly integrated into our daily routines, enriching our lives while fading into the background.


Furthermore, the future of ubiquitous computing is bright. With the ongoing development of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensors, and artificial intelligence, technology is becoming even more deeply ingrained in our surroundings. The advent of smart cities, where data and connectivity enhance urban living, is a prime example of this evolution. We're moving towards a world where computers and devices will adapt to our needs, understand our environments, and anticipate our desires without requiring us to consciously interact with them.

In conclusion, the concept of ubiquitous computing is not a distant vision; it's our current reality, and it's only going to become more integral to our lives. We are on the path to a future where technology is seamlessly woven into our world, allowing us to focus on our goals and experiences rather than the devices themselves. This journey towards an even more integrated, invisible, and empowering technological landscape is an exciting one, and I can't wait to see what the future holds for ubiquitous computing.
Mark Weiser, a pioneer in the field of computing, begins his article by asserting that the most profound technologies are those that disappear into the fabric of everyday life, becoming indistinguishable from it. He draws a parallel with the invention of writing, which freed information from the constraints of individual memory and has now become ubiquitous in our society. We encounter written information in countless forms, from books and magazines to street signs and candy wrappers. It's a part of our daily environment that requires no active attention.
