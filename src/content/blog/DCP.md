Hello ! On this page I will share with you my works in Digital Content Protection


This first practical work (ILLUSTRATIONS ON IMAGE ENCRYPTION AND STEGANOGRAPHY) aims to implement different methods for image encoding and decoding to determine which ones are usable and to identify their weaknesses.

This second practical work (2D Image Filtering) aims to set up various filters and apply them to images to observe their impact and usefulness.

During  this class we made different group projects on the different kinds of digital content protection such as steganography, fingerprinting, blockchain...
With Andrea-Isaac Miens and Thibault Ellong, we chose to make  a project on watermarking. If you are interested here is our <a href="https://github.com/ThibaultEllong/Watermarking"> github</a> and our final presentation :
