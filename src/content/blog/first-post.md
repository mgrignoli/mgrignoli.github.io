Hi everyone !

Last friday during my first lab, I learned with the help of a fellow student, Thibault Ellong (thibaultellong.github.io), how to make a blog with astro.build, and how to deploy it with GitHub. A week before that I had also learned during my Computer Graphic Class, how to setup a Unity project.

#### 1. Building this blog

This is my very first time creating a blog. To chose a good static site generator I followed the advice of my comrades and started to build with Astro.


#### 2. First steps with Unity

#### Syntax

```markdown
